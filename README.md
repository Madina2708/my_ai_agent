# my_ai_agentAI Evaluation Framework — Student Academic Support Agent (ADK)
This repository contains a basic AI agent and an evaluation framework (“AI evals”) to test reliability for key Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) in the Academic Support / Student Productivity domain.
Project Goal
Building the bot is easy; ensuring it works reliably is hard. This project applies AI Evals as “unit tests” for a student-support agent and demonstrates:
domain definition + constraints,
JTBD selection,
synthetic dataset creation,
evaluation criteria (Correctness + Tone & Safety),
pass/fail results and insights.
