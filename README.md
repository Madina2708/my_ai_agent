AI Evaluation Framework — Student Academic Support Agent   

Overview
This repository contains an AI evaluation framework for a student academic support agent focused on academic stress and productivity challenges. The project demonstrates how AI evals can be used to assess not only response correctness, but also emotional safety and real-world usefulness.
Project Goal
The goal of this project is to evaluate whether an AI agent reliably supports key Jobs to Be Done (JTBD), including emotional validation and behavioral activation, rather than simply producing fluent responses.
What’s Included
Defined academic support domain and constraints
Two core JTBDs
Synthetic dataset of realistic student scenarios
Evaluation criteria (Correctness, Tone & Safety)
PASS/FAIL results with aggregated metrics
Key Insight
Evaluation results show strong emotional safety but highlight gaps in action-oriented guidance, demonstrating why outcome-driven evaluation is critical for student-facing AI systems.
